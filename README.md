# Weather Dashboard App
This is a weather dashboard app that allows users to search for a city and view its current and future weather conditions. The app uses the Bulma.io CSS framework for styling and the OpenWeather API for weather data.

## Usage
To use the app, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You will be presented with a search form where you can enter the name of a city.

Once you submit the form, the app will retrieve the current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast for the city you entered, and display the results on the page. The city name will also be added to the search history, which you can access by clicking the "Search History" button.

To view the current weather conditions for a city in the search history, simply click on its name in the list. The app will retrieve and display the weather data for that city.
